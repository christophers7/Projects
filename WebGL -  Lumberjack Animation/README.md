The program generates a scene consisting of four lumberjacks around a central tree atop a green square base. 
There is also a log pile and an additional decorative tree. In the sky is the sun which emits yellow lighting 
and is surrounded by two white clouds. After using the “Animate” checkbox, the lumberjacks begin to strike the 
tree with their axes. Once the axes hit the tree, two wood chips briefly appear above each axe. There is also 
a button which zooms in closer to the scene, and another the returns the zoom to normal. Finally, there is a 
reset button which returns the view to its starting location and stops the animation.
