Aside from basic move/look functionality, move/look smoothing and slope handling are also
incorperated. 

Jump, crouch, and sprint functionally has also been added. Each with it's associated 
movement movement speed multipliers (values are typically recommended to be 0 < x < 1 to slow movement).

Most adjustments to move/look speed, jump height, etc., may be made from the Unity inspector for
